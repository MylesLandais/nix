Analyze the staged or current changes. Generate a concise commit message following the guidelines in CLAUDE.md exactly.

NEVER add emojis, bullet points, numbered lists, attribution, footers, or any ornamental text.

Follow imperative mood, keep the subject under 72 characters, and include a brief body only if the changes warrant explaining "why".

Stage changes if needed, then commit.
